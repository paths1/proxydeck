# Privacy Policy for ProxyDeck

**Last Updated: January 2025**

## Our Commitment to Your Privacy

ProxyDeck is designed with privacy as a fundamental principle. We believe in complete transparency about how our extension operates and want you to feel confident using ProxyDeck.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data. Period.**

### What This Means:

- **No Personal Information**: We don't collect your name, email, or any identifying information
- **No Browsing Data**: We don't track, store, or transmit your browsing history or habits
- **No Analytics**: We don't use any analytics services or tracking codes
- **No Usage Statistics**: We don't monitor how you use the extension
- **No Proxy Traffic**: We don't inspect, log, or store any traffic passing through your proxies
- **No External Servers**: ProxyDeck doesn't communicate with any external servers

## How ProxyDeck Works

ProxyDeck operates entirely within your browser:

1. **Local Storage Only**: All your proxy configurations, routing rules, and preferences are stored locally in your browser using the browser's encrypted storage API
2. **No Cloud Sync**: Your settings remain on your device and are never uploaded anywhere
3. **Direct Proxy Connections**: When you use a proxy, your browser connects directly to that proxy server - ProxyDeck simply tells your browser which proxy to use

## Data That Stays Local

The following information is stored locally in your browser and never leaves your device:

- Proxy server configurations (host, port, credentials)
- URL routing patterns
- Container assignments (Firefox only)
- Traffic statistics (bandwidth monitoring)
- Extension preferences

This data can be cleared at any time by:
- Uninstalling the extension
- Using your browser's "Clear Extension Data" feature
- Resetting ProxyDeck to defaults in the options page

## Permissions We Request

We only request the minimum permissions necessary for ProxyDeck to function:

- **proxy**: To configure proxy settings
- **storage**: To save your settings locally
- **tabs**: To show proxy badges on tabs
- **webRequest**: To monitor bandwidth usage
- **alarms**: To schedule badge updates
- **host_permissions**: To apply proxy rules to websites you specify
- **cookies** (Firefox only): To identify container tabs
- **contextualIdentities** (Firefox only): To support container-based routing

Each permission is used solely for its stated purpose within the extension.

## Third-Party Services

ProxyDeck does not integrate with, communicate with, or send data to any third-party services.

## Security

- All credentials are stored using your browser's encrypted storage mechanism
- ProxyDeck is open source - you can review our code to verify our privacy practices
- We don't have servers that could be compromised because we don't collect data

## Children's Privacy

ProxyDeck does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change this privacy policy, we will:
1. Update the "Last Updated" date at the top
2. Notify users through the extension update notes
3. Never retroactively change our commitment to not collecting data

## Summary

**Your privacy is absolute with ProxyDeck. We don't want your data, we don't collect your data, and we never will.**
