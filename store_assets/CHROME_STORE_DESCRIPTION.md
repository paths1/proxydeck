# ProxyDeck - Advanced Proxy Management for Power Users

Take complete control of your network connections with ProxyDeck, the most flexible proxy management extension for Chrome. Whether you're a developer accessing internal servers, a security professional testing network configurations, or a power user who needs granular control over web traffic, ProxyDeck provides the advanced routing capabilities you need with an intuitive interface.

## **Why ProxyDeck?**

When my job moved work resources behind a jump host, I needed a proxy extension for easier access‚Äîand I also didn't want to route my personal traffic through the corporate network. I tried half a dozen existing solutions, and they mostly fell into these categories:

- **Too complex**: The most popular extensions were overwhelming to configure. I could probably figure them out given enough time, but they weren't well-designed and some options didn't work as expected.
- **Too simple**: Many lacked the features I needed for proper traffic routing and management.
- **Hosted solutions**: The rest were VPN/proxy services that doesn't fit my needs.

What I wanted was straightforward:
- Easy to configure (yes, you need to know regex, but that's it)
- Easy identification through icon badges
- Easy verification of traffic routing with built-in monitoring

And thus ProxyDeck was born.

## Key Features That Set Us Apart
