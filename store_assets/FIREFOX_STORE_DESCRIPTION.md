## Why ProxyDeck for Firefox?

ProxyDeck takes full advantage of Firefox's unique container technology to provide proxy management capabilities that simply aren't possible in other browsers. Configure different proxies for different containers, keeping your work, personal, and client environments completely isolated while maintaining different network paths for each.

## Key Features That Set Us Apart

The killer feature for Firefox users - automatically route different containers through different proxies:
- Assign specific proxies to work, personal, banking, or custom containers
- Keep client environments isolated with dedicated proxy connections
- Maintain multiple authenticated sessions through different proxies
- Perfect separation of concerns for security and privacy
- No manual switching needed - containers remember their proxy settings

### üéØ **Smart Pattern-Based Routing**
Create powerful routing rules using regex patterns to automatically direct specific websites through designated proxies:
- Route development servers through corporate proxies
- Access geo-restricted content through specific proxies
- Isolate sensitive traffic through secure connections
- Test applications across different network paths
- Combine with container routing for ultimate flexibility

### üè∑Ô∏è **Smart Badge System**
- Tab-specific badges show which proxy is active on each tab
- Single-letter abbreviations identify proxies at a glance (e.g., "C" for Corporate, "V" for VPN)
- Color-coded badges match proxy priorities for instant recognition
- Badges update in real-time as you navigate between tabs
- Clear visual indication when no proxy is active

### üìä **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**
Track bandwidth usage with unprecedented detail:
- Monitor total upload/download traffic across all connections
