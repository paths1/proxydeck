# ProxyDeck

A browser extension that routes web traffic through different proxy servers based on URL patterns.

## **Why ProxyDeck?**

When my job moved work resources behind a jump host, I needed a proxy extension for easier accessâ€”and I also didn't want to route my personal traffic through the corporate network. I tried half a dozen existing solutions, and they mostly fell into these categories:

- **Too complex**: The most popular extensions were overwhelming to configure. I could probably figure them out given enough time, but they weren't well-designed and some options didn't work as expected.
- **Too simple**: Many lacked the features I needed for proper traffic routing and management.
- **Hosted solutions**: The rest were VPN/proxy services that doesn't fit my needs.

What I wanted was straightforward:
- Easy to configure (yes, you need to know regex, but that's it)
- Easy identification through icon badges
- Easy verification of traffic routing with built-in monitoring

And thus ProxyDeck was born.

## Features

- **Pattern-Based Routing** - Use regex patterns to automatically route specific websites through designated proxies
- **Multiple Proxy Support** - Configure unlimited SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and HTTP proxies with authentication
- **Visual Indicators** - Tab badges show which proxy is active on each tab
- **Traffic Monitoring** - Track bandwidth usage in real-time across all proxies
- **Container Support** (Firefox) - Route different containers through different proxies
- **Priority System** - Control which proxy handles overlapping patterns
